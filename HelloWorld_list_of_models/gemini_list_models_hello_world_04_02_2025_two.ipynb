            "    *   **Implication:** This can be seen as either daunting or liberating. For existentialists, it means we are free to *create* our own meaning through our choices, actions, and values. For absurdists, it's about acknowledging the inherent conflict between our human desire for meaning and the universe's indifference, and finding joy in the struggle itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Meaning is Given (Religious/Spiritual):**\n",
            "    *   **View:** Life has a divine purpose, bestowed by a higher power, God, or a cosmic order.\n",
            "    *   **Implication:** This meaning often involves fulfilling specific duties, living according to certain moral codes, seeking spiritual growth, achieving salvation, or contributing to a grander spiritual plan. The purpose is external and revealed through faith, scripture, or spiritual experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Meaning is Created or Discovered (Humanism/Various Philosophies):**\n",
            "    *   **View:** While there might not be an inherent, objective meaning, humans are meaning-making creatures. We find or create meaning through our experiences, relationships, contributions, and personal growth.\n",
            "    *   **Common sources of created/discovered meaning include:**\n",
            "        *   **Love and Connection:** Deep relationships with family, friends, partners, and community.\n",
            "        *   **Purpose and Contribution:** Making a positive impact on the world, helping others, pursuing a cause larger than oneself.\n",
            "        *   **Growth and Self-Actualization:** Learning, evolving, developing skills, exploring potential.\n",
            "        *   **Happiness and Well-being:** Experiencing joy, contentment, and satisfaction.\n",
            "        *   **Creativity and Expression:** Producing art, music, writing, innovation.\n",
            "        *   **Understanding and Knowledge:** Seeking truth, learning about the universe, gaining wisdom.\n",
            "        *   **Experiencing Beauty:** Appreciating nature, art, and the wonders of existence.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question.** What brings purpose, joy, and fulfillment to one person might be different for another. It's often less about finding a definitive answer and more about the ongoing process of living, questioning, connecting, and creating that meaning for ourselves.\n"
