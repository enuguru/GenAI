What is the purpose of C++ STL?\\nC++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of generic containers, algorithms, and iterators that provide a way to write efficient and reusable code. The purpose of C++ STL is to provide a set of reusable components that can be used to write efficient and portable C++ programs.\\nThe main goals of C++ STL are:\\n1. To provide a set of reusable components that can be used to write efficient and portable C++ programs.\\n2. To provide a way to write code that is independent of the specific implementation details of the underlying hardware and operating system.\\n3. To provide a way to write code that is easy to maintain and modify.\\n4. To provide a way to write code that is efficient and scalable.\\n\\nThe C++ STL provides a set of containers, algorithms, and iterators that can be used to write efficient and reusable code. The containers include:\\n1. Vectors: A dynamic array that can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.\\n2. Lists: A doubly-linked list that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.\\n3. Maps: A hash table that allows for efficient lookup and insertion of elements.\\n4. Sets: A set of unique elements that can be used to implement a set or a bag.\\n5. Queues: A first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue that can be used to implement a queue or a stack.\\n6. Stacks: A last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack that can be used to implement a stack or a queue.\\n\\nThe algorithms provided by the C++ STL include:\\n1. Sorting algorithms: Such as sort(), stable_sort(), and partial_sort().\\n2. Searching algorithms: Such as find(), find_if(), and find_first_of().\\n3. Manipulation algorithms: Such as copy(), move(), and swap().\\n4. Iteration algorithms: Such as for_each(), for_each_n(), and transform().\\n\\nThe iterators provided by the C++ STL include:\\n1. Random access iterators: Such as vector::iterator and list::iterator.\\n2. Bidirectional iterators: Such as vector::reverse_iterator and list::reverse_iterator.\\n3. Input iterators: Such as istream_iterator and istreambuf_iterator.\\n4. Output iterators: Such as ostream_iterator and ostreambuf_iterator.\\n\\nOverall, the C++ STL provides a powerful and flexible way to write efficient and reusable code, and is an essential part of any C++ programmer's toolkit.\", 'prompt_token_count': 6, 'generation_token_count': 512, 'stop_reason': 'length'}\n"
