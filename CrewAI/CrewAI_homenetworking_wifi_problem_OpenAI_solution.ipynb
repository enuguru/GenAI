            "Here are the recommended solutions to fix the slow Wi-Fi issue in your living room:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Change the Wi-Fi Channel**:\n",
            "   - Access your router's settings by typing its IP address (usually something like 192.168.1.1) into a web browser.\n",
            "   - Log in with your username and password (often found on the router or in the manual).\n",
            "   - Navigate to the wireless settings section and look for the option to change the Wi-Fi channel.\n",
            "   - Select a channel that is less congested. For 2.4 GHz networks, channels 1, 6, and 11 are typically the best options. For 5 GHz networks, you can choose any channel as they are generally less crowded.\n",
            "   - Save the changes and restart your router.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Relocate Your Router**:\n",
            "   - Move your router to a more central location in your home, ideally elevated and away from walls or large furniture that could obstruct the signal.\n",
            "   - Ensure it is placed away from electronic devices that may cause interference, such as microwaves and cordless phones.\n",
            "   - Test the Wi-Fi speed in the living room again to see if the performance improves.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Switch to a Dual-Band Router**:\n",
            "   - If your current router supports dual-band (both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), connect your devices to the 5 GHz band, which is typically less congested and offers faster speeds over shorter distances.\n",
            "   - Ensure that your devices are compatible with the 5 GHz band.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Minimize Interference**:\n",
            "   - Identify and relocate any electronic devices that may be causing interference in the living room, such as microwaves, cordless phones, or Bluetooth devices.\n",
            "   - If possible, turn off these devices temporarily to see if the Wi-Fi performance improves.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Check for Firmware Updates**:\n",
            "   - Log in to your router's settings as mentioned earlier.\n",
            "   - Look for a section that indicates firmware updates.\n",
